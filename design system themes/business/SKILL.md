Read README.md first, then use colors_and_type.css as the single source of truth.

## Quick reference
- Reference color, type, spacing, radius, elevation, and motion tokens by CSS variable name.
- Preserve the paired foreground tokens whenever a semantic background is used.
- Use the local display/body/mono fonts specified in README.md and colors_and_type.css. Reference shared local fonts while working; include required font files and licenses on export. No CDN.
- Keep components coherent with the theme's shape and contrast rather than adding unrelated decoration.

## Local typography

- Display: Space Grotesk; body: DM Sans; numbers/code: IBM Plex Mono with tabular numerals. Korean fallback: Pretendard; finish with generic serif/sans-serif/monospace.
- Body 16–18px, line-height 1.6; supporting copy at least 14px/1.5. Headings 32–64px responsive, line-height 1.15 (Korean 1.3); allow wrapping and 200% zoom without clipping.
- Keep readable contrast (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large text), visible focus, and avoid ultra-light text. Use only supplied weights.
- Reference the shared local font stylesheet while working in BurnGuard; export packages include the required font files and licenses. No CDN, external font import, or system-only replacement. Preserve supplied brand fonts.


## Required layout

Read Navigation, Hero, Footer, Layout and Responsive in README.md before arranging content. Apply the named region patterns and every corresponding --layout-* value; use family tokens for the body. Preserve the theme identity and supplied art. Direction variants may change emphasis but retain these regions unless the user overrides them. Check wide and narrow rendering and 200% zoom.

## Navigation

Follow README.md's Navigation section and the corresponding --layout-* tokens. Use top navigation with a 1360px maximum width and 112px header height. At compact widths, use category rows with chevrons under a compact brand/close bar. Collapse taxonomy columns into grouped disclosures.

## Hero

Follow README.md's Hero section and the corresponding --layout-* tokens. Set the main statement across the top, then split the review evidence left from a narrow action stack right before the media baseline. Retain the theme's existing image-fit, palette, font family and locally generated art unless a written theme invariant requires a more protective framing.

## Footer

Follow README.md's Footer section and the corresponding --layout-* tokens. Reserve 500px as the desktop minimum closing height with 4 information columns or groups. Use native details/summary for the narrow-screen navigation groups if disclosure is needed. The desktop gallery screenshot does not establish a working subscription form, so provide one only when backed by a real flow.
