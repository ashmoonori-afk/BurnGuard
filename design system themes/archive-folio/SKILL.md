description: Use this bundled Archive Folio Theme theme to create token-driven interfaces and visual artifacts.

Read README.md first, then use colors_and_type.css as the single source of truth.

## Quick reference
- Reference color, type, spacing, radius, elevation, and motion tokens by CSS variable name.
- Preserve the paired foreground tokens whenever a semantic background is used.
- Use the local display/body/mono fonts specified in README.md and colors_and_type.css. Copy fonts/ with licenses into outputs and link fonts/fonts.css; no CDN.
- Keep components coherent with the theme's shape and contrast rather than adding unrelated decoration.

## How this theme composes

Lay the page out as a catalogue. A wide image column runs beside a narrow information column of definition pairs, divided by hairline rules that continue the full height. Type is serif and small everywhere, including headings - hierarchy comes from position and rule weight, not from size jumps. Captions sit immediately under their image in the same size as body copy. No radius, no shadow, no accent fills.

## Layout

Use the `--layout-*` tokens; do not invent a grid per artifact. Content sits inside `--layout-max` with `--layout-margin` at the sides, body copy holds to `--layout-measure`, sections are separated by `--layout-section-y`, and dividers use `--layout-rule`. The base grid is `--layout-columns` columns with `--layout-gutter` between them, collapsing at `--layout-bp-md`. Hero media uses `--layout-hero`.

An asymmetric catalogue: an 8-column image track beside a 4-column information column of definition pairs, divided by a hairline rule that runs the full height. Captions sit directly beneath their image at body size; density is high and spacing is tight.

## Local typography

- Display: Newsreader; body: Newsreader; numbers/code: IBM Plex Mono with tabular numerals. Korean fallback: "Nanum Myeongjo" for serif text, "Pretendard" for UI labels; finish with generic serif/sans-serif/monospace.
- Body 16-18px, line-height 1.6; supporting copy at least 14px/1.5. Headings 32-64px responsive, line-height 1.15 (Korean 1.3); allow wrapping and 200% zoom without clipping.
- Keep readable contrast (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large text), visible focus, and avoid ultra-light text. Use only supplied weights.
- Copy the bundled fonts/ directory including licenses into each output and link fonts/fonts.css. No CDN, external font import, or system-only replacement. Preserve supplied brand fonts.
