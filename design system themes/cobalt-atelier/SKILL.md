description: Use this bundled Cobalt Atelier Theme theme to create token-driven interfaces and visual artifacts.
user-invocable: true

Read README.md first, then use colors_and_type.css as the single source of truth.

## Quick reference
- Reference color, type, spacing, radius, elevation, and motion tokens by CSS variable name.
- Preserve the paired foreground tokens whenever a semantic background is used.
- Use the local display/body/mono fonts specified in README.md and colors_and_type.css. Copy fonts/ with licenses into outputs and link fonts/fonts.css; no CDN.
- Keep components coherent with the theme's shape and contrast rather than adding unrelated decoration.

## How this theme composes

Flood a full-bleed cobalt field and let one light-weight serif headline sit in it with real air around it. Label everything else with small uppercase mono eyebrows on `--bg-muted` chips. Interactive elements are hard rectangles or pills in near-black with warm gold text, never soft cards. Separate regions with single hairline rules at `--border`, not with panels or shadows.

## Layout

Use the `--layout-*` tokens; do not invent a grid per artifact. Content sits inside `--layout-max` with `--layout-margin` at the sides, body copy holds to `--layout-measure`, sections are separated by `--layout-section-y`, and dividers use `--layout-rule`. The base grid is `--layout-columns` columns with `--layout-gutter` between them, collapsing at `--layout-bp-md`. Hero media uses `--layout-hero`.

Hold a single wide column for the headline and let supporting blocks occupy 5 of the 12 columns, offset rather than centred. Hairline rules at --layout-rule mark section boundaries; never box a section in a card.

## Local typography

- Display: Instrument Serif; body: Instrument Sans; numbers/code: IBM Plex Mono with tabular numerals. Korean fallback: "Gowun Batang", "Pretendard" for serif headings, "Pretendard" for body; finish with generic serif/sans-serif/monospace.
- Body 16-18px, line-height 1.6; supporting copy at least 14px/1.5. Headings 32-64px responsive, line-height 1.15 (Korean 1.3); allow wrapping and 200% zoom without clipping.
- Keep readable contrast (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large text), visible focus, and avoid ultra-light text. Use only supplied weights.
- Copy the bundled fonts/ directory including licenses into each output and link fonts/fonts.css. No CDN, external font import, or system-only replacement. Preserve supplied brand fonts.
